# Guess the Number Game

This is a command-line game implemented in Python where the player has to guess a randomly generated number within a certain range.

## How to Play

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from the official website: [Python.org](https://www.python.org/)

2. Clone this repository or download the source code files to your local machine.

3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the game files.

4. Run the following command to start the game:
   ```
   python guess_the_number.py
   ```

5. The game will display a welcome message and a game title ASCII art.

6. You will be asked to choose a difficulty level. Type either 'easy' or 'hard' and press Enter. 
   - Easy: You will have 10 attempts to guess the number.
   - Hard: You will have 5 attempts to guess the number.

7. The game will generate a random number between 1 and 100. You need to enter your guess within this range.

8. After each guess, the game will inform you if your guess was too low or too high.

9. Keep guessing until you find the correct number within the given number of attempts.

10. If you guess the correct number, the game will congratulate you and display a success message.

11. If you run out of attempts without guessing the correct number, the game will inform you that you have lost.

12. The game will exit after you win or lose. If you want to play again, you need to run the command again.
